# Go Error Handling

* Author: Cameron Wright

## Overview

Repository for understanding error handling and testing with Go.

## Manifest

A listing of source files and other non-generated files and a brief (one line)
explanation of the purpose of each file.

## Building the project

This section should tell the user how to build your code.  If you are delivering a library or
a jar file, where does it need to be installed or how do you use it? Is this an executable,
if so how can a user get up to speed as fast as possible.

## Features and usage

Summarize the main features of your program. It is also appropriate to instruct the user how
to use your program.

## Testing

This section should detail how you tested your code. Simply stating "I ran it a few times and
it seems to work" is not sufficient. Your testing needs to be detailed here or even better,
this section should document the appropriate smoke/unit/system tests that you wrote. For a
homework, I don't expect much but for a project this section should have significant content.

### Known Bugs

List known bugs that you weren't able to fix (or ran out of time to fix).

## Discussion

Discuss the issues you encountered during development and testing. What problems did you have? What
did you have to research and learn on your own? What kinds of errors did you get? How did you
fix them?
